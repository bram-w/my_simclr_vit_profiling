Trying to do multi-clustering objective from slides
PRETTY sure that it will avoid collapse b/c that would result in individual clusters that are uniform at some level
Biggest concern I suppose is just collapsing to uniform for everybody. Might have to upweight self sim loss to avoid that



Possible tuning tweaks:
- Mean or other normalization over los besides sum
- Masking out diagonal in cluster dissim term (might not matter)
- Incorporation of cross entropy for good behavior?
